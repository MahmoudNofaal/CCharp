# C# *onlearn*

Welcome to the **C# onlearn**! This repository helps you learn C# programming in a simple way. It’s good for beginners and intermidate developers who want to build ASP.NET Core apps (like APIs and web apps). Each topic has easy explanations and code examples to help you understand and practice.

This repo is part of a bigger learning plan that includes separate repos for LINQ, EF Core, APIs, and MVC. Here, we focus on C# basics and advanced topics to make you ready for ASP.NET.

## What You’ll Learn

I’ve organized the topics into groups to make learning easy. Each topic has a short explanation and code you can try. Here’s what’s included:

### Basics
- **Variables**: How to store data like numbers and text.
- **Arrays**: Lists of data.
- **Methods**: Functions that do tasks, like calculating a total.
- **Fields and Constants**: Places to save data that don’t change or change rarely.
- **Constructors (CTORS)**: Special methods to set up objects.
- **Properties**: Smart ways to get or set data in objects.
- **Boolean and Operators**: True/false logic and math operations (like AND, OR).

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Inheritance**: Sharing features between classes, like a car inheriting from a vehicle.
- **Interfaces**: Rules for classes to follow, like a blueprint.
- **Generics**: Flexible code that works with any data type.
- **Casting and Type Conversion**: Changing one data type to another, like text to number.

### Collections (Data Lists)
- **ArrayList**: Old way to store lists (not used much now).
- **Hashtable**: Old way to store key-value pairs (not common).
- **Dictionary**: Modern way to store key-value pairs, like a phonebook.
- **Queue**: First-In-First-Out (FIFO) list, like a line at a store.
- **Stack**: Last-In-First-Out list (LIFO), like a stack of plates.
- **LinkedList**: List where items link to each other, good for adding/removing.
- **IEnumerable and ICollection**: Tools to loop through or manage lists.

### Advanced Topics
- **Indexers**: Access objects like arrays.
- **Delegates**: Point to methods, like a shortcut to run code.
- **Events**: Trigger actions, like clicking a button.
- **Operator Overloading**: Change how operators (like +) work for your objects.
- **Finalizers**: Clean up resources (rarely used).
- **Extension Methods**: Add new features to existing types.
- **Expressions**: Build dynamic code, like math formulas.

### Performance and File Handling
- **StreamIO**: Read or write files, like saving data.
- **Serialization**: Turn objects into JSON or XML for APIs.
- **StringBuilder**: Fast way to work with text.

### Multi-Tasking
- **Threading**: Run multiple tasks at once, like background jobs.
- **Asynchronous**: Run tasks without waiting, like loading a webpage.

### Modern C# Features
- **Records**: Simple, unchangeable data types.
- **Tuples**: Group multiple values, like a name and age.
- **NULLs**: Handle missing data safely.
